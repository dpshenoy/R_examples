# R_examples

## Some examples I've prepared using various functions/tools in R_examples

### SampleMean_as_fn_of_n.ipynb -- a Jupyter Notebook that plots the probability that a sample Mean is within a certain distance $d$ of the true mean, as a function of sample size $n$

### CI_with_t_test.ipynb -- a Jupyter Notebook that uses an example data set to discuss confidence intervals, and using t.test() to get a confidence interval.
